Hunter-builder

Make a super aggressive guy to test against as well - 3 hunters


Need more thought:
- Make the ships go to the same planet at the start (faster generation of new guy)
- A* search to find shortest paths
- Can fly in formations when attacking - create a Formation entity which is made up of ships and has a radius etc. so static - can move in unison - needs to define the 'target locations' of ships inside the formation depending on size
- Really try to intercept - predict path and make an isosceles triangle
- Fail safe against super aggressive opponents (if they attack with 3 ships at the start...)

Ready to implement:
- Allocate jobs more efficiently - connect the two closest, remove, repeat -> not a super big improvement ~10% distance reduction (and high computation cost - can use numpy though)
- Interceptor predictive enemy-targeting
