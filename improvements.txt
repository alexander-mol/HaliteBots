IMPROVEMENTS

Need more thought:
- Fail safe against super aggressive opponents (if they attack with 3 ships at the start...)
- tracking enemies over more time periods to estimate position better
- upgrade 'good planet' definition using ellipses (planet center, closest enemy) radius ~(4 + 2)*7 ~ 56 only dock if more friendlies than enemies in there
- Really try to intercept - predict path and make an isosceles triangle - also helps with pack formation
- Use 'center' for attacks and 'closest' for defense

Ready to implement:
- see what happens if you turn off everything relating to tethering
- reduce throttling so that it only triggers at like 1750 or something
- implement optimal planet approach dist for guys going to planets (it is 3.5, so do 3.45)
- turn off pack radius after finishing it's navigation for a turn - so other guys can join

To categorize:
- Pack leader shouldn't switch around - makes it inefficient
