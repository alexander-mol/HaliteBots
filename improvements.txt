IMPROVEMENTS

Need more thought:
- tracking enemies over more time periods to estimate position better
- Really try to intercept - predict path and make an isosceles triangle - also helps with pack formation
- Use 'center' for attacks and 'closest' for defense
- Try to understand how our current nav algo works - why do packs sometimes stop completely? - is the distance_reduction_factor useful?

Ready to implement:
- see what happens if you turn off everything relating to tethering (play against version with tethering)
- reduce throttling so that it only triggers at like 1750 or something - can also reduce ghost points
    - consider calculating: nav calc time / (fighting ships * num obstacles (final)) - this may be a good predictor
- figure out how packs can have a size > 4 ? - is it because there was an enemy docked in the planet defense range? - maybe fix this (packs too big)
- turn off pack radius after finishing it's navigation for a turn - so other guys can join
- calculation metric to speed up improvement process: keep track of total lost health from non docked guys on both sides

To categorize:
- Pack leader shouldn't switch around - makes it inefficient

Good planet - needs to improve:
- don't target if you have guys there already
- upgrade 'good planet' definition using ellipses (planet center, closest enemy) radius ~(4 + 2)*7 ~ 56 only dock if more friendlies than enemies in there


MAP SEEDS
Micro-Manager v 3 x Interceptor:
- 74850485 - difficult for player 0, 2 - Micro-Manger rank: 3 with benefit factor 1, 1.7
- 550078535 - Micro-Manger rank: 4 - docking too aggressively - beaten with benefit_factor = 2
