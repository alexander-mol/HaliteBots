IMPROVEMENTS

Need more thought:
- tracking enemies over more time periods to estimate position better
- Really try to intercept - predict path and make an isosceles triangle - also helps with pack formation
- Try to understand how our current nav algo works - why do packs sometimes stop completely? - is the distance_reduction_factor useful?
- Kamikaze for low health guys (if health below trigger level, and enemy is nearby (within 7) then target the enemy with approach = 0
    - have a list of 'kamikaze ships' which gets filled in job allocation - then in determining approach dist - check if in kamikaze list
    - use my_free_ships after tether determination

NOTE:
MOBILE ENEMIES WAS BEING CALCULATED INCORRECTLY "<" instead of ">" (hence why dogfighting approach didn't work)
- That means the 'safety' strategy made guys go bonkers when they attacked docked enemies
- If improvements seem worse than before go back to this error and try to find out why it works...

Important:
- Do more analysis on 4 person maps
- Planets should get a relative benefit factor based on distance from center of map
    - maybe just different benefit factor if center of map 2 x 2 planets - keep things simple
- Build fail safe for overly aggressive opponents - if opp tries to rush - then need make a super compact defensive formation that moves away from the attackers
- More analysis with super aggressive attacker - maybe seek safety needs to be upgraded to center attacker's radius on
    him instead of on the defending ship...
- OPTIMIZE THE NEW MICRO FIGHTING PARAMETERS
- MAKE SMART NAVIGATION BETTER...

To categorize:


Good planet - needs to improve:
- don't target if you have guys there already
- upgrade 'good planet' definition using ellipses (planet center, closest enemy) radius ~(4 + 2)*7 ~ 56 only dock if more friendlies than enemies in there


MAP SEEDS
Micro-Manager v 3 x Interceptor:
- 74850485 - difficult for player 0, 2 - Micro-Manger rank: 3 with benefit factor 1, 1.7
- 550078535 - Micro-Manger rank: 4 - docking too aggressively - beaten with benefit_factor = 2
