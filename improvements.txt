Hunter-builder

- Avoid early crashes
- Enemies that are attacking our docked ships should be attacked by the nearest hunters


New type:
- The deadly stream - >>>>>>, first ship is a bit slower, so the stream can form - then it can snake around and kill
    effectively

Make a super aggressive guy to test against as well - 3 hunters

Interceptors need to use swarm tactics! - Hunters too.
