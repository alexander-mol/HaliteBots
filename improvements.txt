IMPROVEMENTS

Need more thought:
- tracking enemies over more time periods to estimate position better
- Really try to intercept - predict path and make an isosceles triangle - also helps with pack formation
- Use 'center' for attacks and 'closest' for defense
- Try to understand how our current nav algo works - why do packs sometimes stop completely? - is the distance_reduction_factor useful?
- calculation metric to speed up improvement process: keep track of total lost health from non docked guys on both sides

Ready to implement:
- Kamikaze for low health guys (if health below trigger level, and enemy is nearby (within 7) then target the enemy with approach = 0
    - have a list of 'kamikaze ships' which gets filled in job allocation - then in determining approach dist - check if in kamikaze list
    - use my_free_ships after tether determination
- Also a different relative benefit factor for docking at empty planets
- If outnumbered - should seek safety
- Do more analysis on 4 person maps

To categorize:
- Pack leader shouldn't switch around - makes it inefficient

Good planet - needs to improve:
- don't target if you have guys there already
- upgrade 'good planet' definition using ellipses (planet center, closest enemy) radius ~(4 + 2)*7 ~ 56 only dock if more friendlies than enemies in there


MAP SEEDS
Micro-Manager v 3 x Interceptor:
- 74850485 - difficult for player 0, 2 - Micro-Manger rank: 3 with benefit factor 1, 1.7
- 550078535 - Micro-Manger rank: 4 - docking too aggressively - beaten with benefit_factor = 2
