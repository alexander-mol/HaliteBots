Hunter-builder

Make a super aggressive guy to test against as well - 3 hunters


Need more thought:
- Make the ships go to the same planet at the start (faster generation of new guy)
- A* search to find shortest paths
- Can fly in formations when attacking - create a Formation entity which is made up of ships and has a radius etc. so
    static - can move in unison - needs to define the 'target locations' of ships inside the formation depending on
    size - can spontaneously create when ships are close anyways
- Really try to intercept - predict path and make an isosceles triangle
- Fail safe against super aggressive opponents (if they attack with 3 ships at the start...)
- If ship is outnumbered by attackers it should seek safety - or kamikaze

- Better routing using A* with graph building - and location prediction to avoid crashing own guys
    - could pre-analyze the map to create the graph

Serious:
- need to target planets that are not the closest opportunity -> just one guy can turn the tide later on
- if guy is outnumbered he should seek safety
- consider targeting own dudes when they attack (create formation organically)
- when attacking, should have support (e.g. when attacking docked ships)
- really need to avoid self crashes
- can make a probability of success model for various actions (docking at a spot, traveling to a spot) - using ML on past game data
- job matrix in terms of benefit - ships on the LHS should also include 'packs'
    - can express benefit in terms of rate of return on ship production rate delta discounted 2% per turn over the life
    of the game x probability of success
- tracking enemies over more time periods to estimate position better

Ready to implement:
- in defense, select a leader, he targets the enemy, other guys follow the leader
- if a ship decides to go for an attack opportunity, then he should be on a special list for other ships to follow
- reduce throttling so that it only triggers at like 1750 or something
- need additional throttling - for ships that are far away from the action - don't use them in job search and have them be zombies with navigate(ignore_ships=True)
