Hunter-builder

Make a super aggressive guy to test against as well - 3 hunters


Need more thought:
- Make the ships go to the same planet at the start (faster generation of new guy)
- A* search to find shortest paths
- Can fly in formations when attacking - create a Formation entity which is made up of ships and has a radius etc. so
    static - can move in unison - needs to define the 'target locations' of ships inside the formation depending on
    size - can spontaneously create when ships are close anyways
- Really try to intercept - predict path and make an isosceles triangle
- Fail safe against super aggressive opponents (if they attack with 3 ships at the start...)
- If ship is outnumbered by attackers it should seek safety - or kamikaze

- Better routing using A* with graph building - and location prediction to avoid crashing own guys
    - could pre-analyze the map to create the graph

Ready to implement:
- also attack with 4 guys per opportunity
